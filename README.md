## Notes

Installing Podfiles took a while to figure out.
I was still trying to implement the search function but is partially complete so I decided to not include the functionality yet. I will continue to work on it and hopefully be able to get it done soon.
I also spent some time installing the virtual machine from which to run Mac OS X
